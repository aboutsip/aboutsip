     * value of a 16-bit word. The largest datagram that any host is required to
     * be able to reassemble is 576 bytes, but most modern hosts handle much
     * larger packets. Sometimes subnetworks impose further restrictions on the
     * packet size, in which case datagrams must be fragmented. Fragmentation is
     * handled in either the host or router in IPv4.
